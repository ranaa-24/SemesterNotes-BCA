ðŸ“Œ Step 1: Learn the Fundamentals of System Design (Basics)
Before jumping into architecture, you need to understand:

âœ… How the web works

Client-Server Model (Request-Response Cycle)
HTTP, HTTPS, WebSockets
REST API vs GraphQL
âœ… Databases (SQL vs NoSQL)

SQL (Relational DBs like MySQL, PostgreSQL) â†’ Strong consistency
NoSQL (MongoDB, DynamoDB, Cassandra) â†’ Horizontal scalability
âœ… Networking Basics

Load Balancers, Firewalls, DNS
CDNs (Cloudflare, Akamai)
âœ… Scalability Basics

Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling
Caching (Redis, Memcached)
Database Indexing & Partitioning
ðŸ“Œ Step 2: High-Level Design (HLD) â€“ Architectural Design
ðŸ“Œ Goal: Create an overview of the system without deep implementation details.

âœ… 1. Define System Architecture

Monolithic vs Microservices
N-Tier Architecture (Frontend â†’ Backend â†’ Database)
Event-Driven Architecture (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
âœ… 2. Identify Key Components

Authentication & Authorization (JWT, OAuth)
Database Layer (SQL vs NoSQL, ACID vs BASE)
Caching Mechanisms (Redis for fast lookups, CDN for static files)
âœ… 3. Scalability Considerations

Load Balancing (Nginx, HAProxy)
Sharding & Replication for DBs
Asynchronous Processing (Kafka, RabbitMQ, Celery)
âœ… 4. Data Consistency & Availability (CAP Theorem)

Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance
When to choose AP (NoSQL) vs CP (SQL)
ðŸ“Œ Step 3: Low-Level Design (LLD) â€“ Code-Level Implementation
ðŸ“Œ Goal: Convert HLD into concrete, detailed implementation using OOP, Design Patterns, and Databases.

âœ… 1. Object-Oriented Design (OOD)

SOLID Principles (Best coding practices)
UML Diagrams (Class Diagrams, Sequence Diagrams)
âœ… 2. Database Schema Design

Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)
ER Diagram (Entities & Relationships)
âœ… 3. API Design (RESTful & GraphQL APIs)

Endpoint structuring (GET /users, POST /bookings)
Authentication (JWT, OAuth)
Pagination & Rate Limiting
âœ… 4. Caching Strategies

Redis (Key-Value Store for quick lookups)
CDN (for serving static assets)
ðŸ“Œ Step 4: Design Patterns (Reusable Solutions to Common Problems)
ðŸ“Œ Goal: Use proven solutions for building maintainable & scalable systems.

âœ… 1. Creational Patterns (For object creation)

Singleton â†’ One instance of a class (DB connection)
Factory â†’ Object creation without specifying the exact class
âœ… 2. Structural Patterns (For organizing code)

Adapter â†’ Converts one interface to another
Decorator â†’ Adds new behavior dynamically
âœ… 3. Behavioral Patterns (For object interactions)

Observer â†’ Used for event-driven systems (e.g., Webhooks, Notification Systems)
Strategy â†’ Dynamically switch algorithms (e.g., Payment gateways)
ðŸ“Œ Step 5: Advanced System Design Concepts
ðŸ“Œ Goal: Build real-world, scalable distributed systems.

âœ… 1. Scalability & Performance Optimization

Load Balancing (Round Robin, Least Connections, IP Hashing)
Database Sharding & Replication
Rate Limiting (Throttle API calls to prevent abuse)
âœ… 2. Distributed Systems

Message Queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
Eventual Consistency (BASE vs ACID)
Leader Election Algorithms (Raft, Paxos)
âœ… 3. Observability & Monitoring

Logging (ELK Stack, Loki)
Tracing (Jaeger, OpenTelemetry)
Metrics (Prometheus, Grafana)
âœ… 4. Security & Compliance

Data Encryption (AES, TLS, HTTPS)
DDoS Protection (Cloudflare, AWS Shield)
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
ðŸ“Œ Step 6: Practical Projects & System Design Interviews
ðŸ“Œ Goal: Apply system design concepts in real-world scenarios & interviews.

âœ… 1. System Design Case Studies

URL Shortener (Bit.ly Clone)
E-commerce System (Amazon, Flipkart Clone)
Food Delivery App (Swiggy, UberEats Clone)
Chat System (WhatsApp, Slack Clone)
âœ… 2. Participate in System Design Interviews

Design Netflix-like Video Streaming Platform
Design Scalable Ride-Sharing System (Uber, Ola)
Design Real-Time Notification System (Facebook, Instagram)
